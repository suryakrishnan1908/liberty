        <h4>Hi, I’m Surya Krishnan, a digital artist and electronic engineer. With a passion for both creativity and technology, I’ve carved out a unique niche where these two worlds intersect. As a digital illustrator and video editor, I produce intricate mashup videos of movies for my YouTube channel, blending elements from various films to create fresh and exciting narratives. My expertise in tools like Adobe Creative Suite and Final Cut Pro allows me to bring these visions to life with precision and flair.

            On the engineering front, my background in electronics has provided me with a deep understanding of PLCs, sensors, and other key components. I’ve had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with these technologies, particularly during my inplant training at Sudharshanam Fabrics. This technical knowledge not only complements my artistic endeavors but also enables me to explore innovative ways to integrate electronics into my creative projects, such as interactive installations and sensor-based artworks.</h4>
